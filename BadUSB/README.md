Here you can find my BadUSB scripts for Flipper Zero. </BR>
Some are scripts for Rubber Ducky that also fit the "Flipper Zero" without modifications, 
others have been adapted, and still others have been written specifically for it. </BR>
In each folder you will find the relevant README file with links and explanations. </BR>
